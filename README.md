# Gene Co-expression Network analysis of Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma data
Abstract
> We performed a gene co-expression analysis on Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma data to find modules (groups) of genes that may highly impact the growth of these type of tumors. Additionally, we used cancer survival data to relate modules to prognostic significance in terms of survival time. Analysis on RNA-seq data revealed modules which are significant in gene enrichment analysis. Specifically, two genes - RFC4 and ECT2 - have been found to be significant in terms of survival time. We also performed a second gene co-expression analysis on a second dataset of microarray data, and many significant genes found in this analysis could also be found in the RNA-seq data implying that these genes might indeed play a crucial role in Lung Squamous Cancer.

This was a class project I did for the Systems Biology course at Iowa State during the spring of 2016. The R code for the analysis can be found in this repository. The data can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qzp4qsjxu9xx7pz/AABYRZgm0FRdEREKyiOjTJ3Ra?dl=0). The data is disorganized, so if you want to reproduce the results, check out the code, and find the relevant files used in the code from the data. Please cite the arxiv paper if you use the code (the original code was taken from the WGCNA website, and modified for my purposes).
